These are talon files for my games for reference.

I rely on `game_tools` for most game actions, which automatically fire events that `ui_elements` can listen to.

I rely on `ui_elements` to display UI.

When using parrot (most games), I rely on `parrot_config` to setup combos easily.

If using default Talon, I rely on `dynamic_noises` for dynamically changing pop and hiss.

If using xbox gamepad emulation, I rely on `vgamepad`
