# roku_games

These are talon files for my games for reference.

I rely on `game_tools` for most of my game actions

I rely on `parrot_config` to manage my parrot commands which allows me to setup combo sounds easily.

I rely on `ui_elements` to display my commands and the keys. This uses an HTML-like syntax.

## Dependencies:
- Talon beta so that I can use parrot.py
- Your own trained parrot model
