# Red Dead Redemption 2

## Dependencies

- Free version of Talon
- Windows or linux required (does not work for mac), because of `vgamepad` dependency
- `roku-talon-shared` in your `[TALON_HOME]/user` directory
- `vgamepad` needs to be manually installed by following the instructions in the `roku-talon-shared/vgamepad/README.md` so that we can use xbox controller emulation. This is necessary to enable aim assist in the game.
