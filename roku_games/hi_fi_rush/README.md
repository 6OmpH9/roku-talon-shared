# Dependencies

- Talon beta
- Your own trained parrot model. The more noises the better. I use 14 noises.
- `roku-talon-shared` in your `[TALON_HOME]/user` directory
- Lazy susan + air mouse
  - For my feet to control the camera, I use a 16' flat lazy susan with an air mouse velcroed to the center. Air mouse should have at least 1 minute timeout, fairly small, and have a space to attach velcro.
